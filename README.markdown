# TimL

Lisp implementation in pure Vim, yo.

Start a repl with `:TLrepl`.

Put files in `autoload/*.tim` and they will be automatically loaded into the
corresponding namespace.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/timl.git
